## Reanalysis data
For the description of reanalysis, please find releveant literatures or blogs. 

### ERA5

For me, there are two primary kinds of ERA5 data to use for driving atmospheric model:
1. [ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview)
2. [ERA5 hourly data on single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview)

Find my experiences of downloading ERA5 data in [here](./ERA5/How_to_download_ERA5_dataset.md)
